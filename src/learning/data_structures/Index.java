	// Queue using LinkedList
	// Priority Queue
	// Singly Linked List
	 		In singly linked list, Node has data and pointer to next node. It does not have pointer to the previous node. 
	 		Last node ‘s next points to null, so you can iterate over linked list by using this condition.
	// Double Linked List 
	 		In doubly linked list, Node has data and pointers to next node and previous node.You can iterate over linkedlist 
	 		either in forward or backward direction as it has pointers to prev node and next node. 
	 		This is one of most used data structures in java.
	// Binary Tree
	 		A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, 
	 		which are referred to as the left child and the right child
	// Binary Search Tree
			Nodes which are smaller than root will be in left subtree.
			Nodes which are greater than root will be right subtree.
			It should not have duplicate nodes
			Both left and right subtree also should be binary search tree.
	//Trie
	 	Trie is data structure which is used to store in such a way that data can be retrieved faster.
		Some real time examples:
		Trie can be used to implement Dictionary.		
		We can put words in Trie and its children linkedlist will have its child nodes.
		Let’s say you want to insert do, deal , dear , he , hen , heat etc.	
	
	//Heap
		A min heap is complete binary tree based data structure in which value of root node is less than 
		or equal to value of child nodes.
	//Graph (https://www.baeldung.com/java-graphs)
		Graph is a data structure for storing connected data  like a network of people on a social media
		It contains group of vertices and edges
		Graph can be of two types: Directed and undirected
		It contains group of vertices and edges
		Graph can be disjoint or connected and there are various algorithms such as depth first search to find this out.
		//Directed Graph
		//Weighted Graph
		//Graph Representations
		 	//Adjacency Matrix
		 	//Adjacency List
		// Graph Traversal
		 	//Depth-First Traversal
		 	//Breadth-First Traversal
