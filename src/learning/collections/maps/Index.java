/**
 * There are four . commonly used implementations of Map in Java SE: HashMap, TreeMap, Hashtable, and LinkedHashMap. If we use one sentence to describe each implementation, it would be the following:   

 HashMapis implemented as a hash table, and there is no ordering on keys or values. 
 TreeMap is implemented based on red-black tree structure, and it is ordered by the key. 
 LinkedHashMap preserves the insertion order
 Hashtable  is synchronized in contrast to HashMap. 
This gives us the reason that HashMap should be used if it is thread-safe since Hashtable has overhead for synchronization.
