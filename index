	 *  Structured Data + ACID -> RDDBMS (MySQL, ORacle, Postgres, SQL Server). Ex :user, employee data
	 *  Non - Structured Data + Different characteristics of entity + Complex queries -> Document DB (Mongo DB, Couch Base). Ex: ecommerce with t-shirt, mobile,fridge,..
	 *  Non - Structured Data + Ever Increasing Data +finite (less) queries ->  Columnar DB (Cassandra, HBase) Ex: Uber driver sending locations

Below are some common Big-O functions while analyzing algorithms.

O(1) - constant time
O(log(n)) - logarithmic time
O((log(n))^c) - polylogarithmic time
O(n) - linear time
O(n^2) - quadratic time
O(n^c) - polynomial time
O(c^n) - exponential time
O(n!) - factorial time
(n = size of input, c = some constant)
